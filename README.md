AudioSwitch
===========

If you are using multiple audio devices at the 
same time, you might want to switch between them 
from time to time. As far as I know the only way 
possible to do this is via the control panel. 
Microsoft has not made it possible to do this gracefully
via some API. 

This tiny program simply opens the control panel
and simulates user input to switch between audio 
devices. Works fairly well.
